# STEP 3: Define a randomNumbers function that takes a number as a parameter.
	# STEP 4a: Create an empty array called result
	# STEP 5: Create a loop that runs n times
		# STEP 6: Generate a random number between 0 and 100. Add the number to the result array.
	# STEP 4b: Return the result array variable

# STEP 9: Define a largerThan function that takes an array of numbers and a single number as parameters.
    # STEP 10: Create an empty array called result
    # STEP 11: Create a loop that runs once for each item in the list/array parameter
    	# STEP 12: Write an if statement to test if the current value in the list is greater than the number parameter
    		# STEP 13: If true, write another if statement to test if the current value in the list is not already in the result array
    			# STEP 14: If true, add the current value in the list to the result array
    # STEP 15: Print the list array variable. Label it "List of numbers".
    # STEP 16: Sort the result array variable and print it. Label it "Numbers that are greater than [n]"

  howMany = def getNum(prompt, minValue = -float("inf"), maxValue = float("inf"), totalAttempts = float("inf"), convertToInt = False, invalidMsg = "Invalid number."):
  # STEP 2: Call a randomNumbers function, passing the howMany variable as an argument. Assign the result to a variable called list.
  # STEP 7: Prompt the user for a number between 0 and 100. Assign the user's response to a variable called n.
  # STEP 8: Call a largerThan function, passing the list and n variables as arguments.
